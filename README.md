# WWW 2022 - Course Project

## Topic - Chords editor/player

## Course project for Web Development course during the 6th semester at FMI, Sofia University.

The project has two main functionalities - chords visualizer for different instruments (currently only piano) and displaying song lyrics with chords.

The chords visualizer shows how each of the 12 main chords (with major/minor) variantion can be played in each of the 3 inversions. Additionally there is sound preview of the chord in each inversion played note by note and the chord as a whole.

The song lyrics with/without chords display the text of a song along with it's meta information such as title, author, tempo, key, time signature and youtube video.
Above the text are the chords of the song which can be transposed dynamically in any key. Furthermore, the user can learn the chords used in the song since they are extracted from the lyrics autmatically and linked to the chords visualizer.

Basic user authentication is developed. Users can create and log into accounts. For now logged in users can add new songs to the database.

The web app is developed using PHP as backend and plain HTML, CSS and JS for the frontend. The database is MySQL.
